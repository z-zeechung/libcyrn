# `libcyrn`

`cyrn` (short for `cyrnewic`) is a JavaScript runtime currently under development. It aims to reimplement Node's internal bindings in portable C code to provide lightweight, cross-platform, and scalable Node-compatible runtimes.

This is the source code repository for `cyrn`'s built-in libraries, offering uncompiled library C and JS code. These codes were decoupled from Node's original source. Here, these codes are tested, and LLM agents are leveraged to ensure reliable alignment with Node's behavior. Documentation standards are also established, along with some script tools that may aid in runtime development.
